# TLDRMissions
Issue tracker for TLDRMissions addon for World of Warcraft

Releases for this addon are available on CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tldr-missions/files

Common questions:

Q: The number of simulations is really high. Is it broken?

A: Some missions involve "randomness", such as spells that have a random target. When this happens, the addon could take a long time to find a way to guarantee success. If you would prefer the addon finds solutions more quickly, change some of the advanced settings. Perhaps lower the level restriction, so low level minions aren't tested on high level missions.
