**What this involves:**

1. You will be given a comand to run in-game to enable "DEVTESTING" mode.

2. When you complete a mission, if the combat log did not exactly match the combat log that the simulator was expecting, you will see a message in chat like "DEVTESTING: Discrepancy for mission 2221"

3. If/when this happens, logout, create an issue, tell me the mission ID that was in that message, and upload the saved variables for the character you were just playing when the message appeared.

4. I will take it from there, will investigate why the combat log didn't match, and make fixes to the addon if needed.
